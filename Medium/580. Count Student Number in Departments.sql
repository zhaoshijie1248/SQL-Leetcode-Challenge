Write an SQL query to report the respective department name and number of students majoring in each department for all departments in the Department table (even ones with no current students).

Return the result table ordered by student_number in descending order. In case of a tie, order them by dept_name alphabetically.

The query result format is in the following example.


solution:


select dept_name, count(distinct student_id) as student_number
from Student s right join Department d
on s.dept_id=d.dept_id
group by 1
order by 2 desc, 1 asc


summary:

注意inner join 和 right/left join的区别，有些原数据中不存在的类别也要统计进去

order by 2 desc, 1 asc
